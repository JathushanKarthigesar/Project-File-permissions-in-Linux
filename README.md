The research team at my organization needs to update the file permissions for certain files and
directories within the projects directory. The permissions do not currently reflect the level of
authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep
their system secure. To complete this task, I performed the following tasks:

- Check file and directory details
- Describe the permissions string
- Change file permissions
- Change file permissions on a hidden file
- Change directory permissions
